<!--
     When you go for treatment, tell the hospital (or place where you are being treated) that you
want to claim back the cost of your journey. If your place of treatment issues payments, you
will be able to claim your money back during your visit. They will ask you to show proof of
your entitlement, such as your award notice, your NHS Tax Credit Exemption Certificate.
You will need to keep any tickets or receipts you have as proof of the cost. If your place of
treatment does not issue payments (for example, a GP practice or dental surgery where you
have been referred for specialist treatment), you will need to claim your expenses using claim
form HC5(T). Read page 27 about how to claim a refund.
